# Statistics

QuickSearch collects usage statistics in a MySQL database for searches and clicks for every searcher that is included in your interface. It includes an interface where you can view these statistics as well at the following URL:

	  http://path.to.quicksearch/appstats

QuickSearch can also use Google Analytics to collect usage statistics. To use this feature, specify your Google Analytics tracking ID in the config/quick_search_config.yml file under the key “google_analytics_tracking_id”
