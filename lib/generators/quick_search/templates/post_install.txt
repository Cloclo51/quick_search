QuickSearch installation complete.

We've installed a generic theme and a few searchers that will work out of the box.

To add/remove/replace searchers:

1. Add searcher gems (see README for list of gems) to your project's Gemfile
2. Add a theme gem to Gemfile (see README)
3. Add the searchers/theme to quick_search_config.yml
4. Add render_module calls to search results view for each searcher
